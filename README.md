# dynamicschedule
Combination of two Angular demos. Real time scheduling, and a multi step form, using Firebase as the backend API.
Firebase URL https://angularschedule.firebaseio.com. Appointment is booked when user selects a time slot, the slot is now unavailable to other users. Each section of the form must be filled out. On completion the user pushes all the information they have entered to Firebase. The reset function clears all appointment times and client data.
